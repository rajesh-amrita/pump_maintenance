# Predictive Maintenance Dataset for CG-IPM-15 Pump

This repository contains a six-month synthetic dataset generated to emulate the operational behavior of a Crompton Greaves CG-IPM-15 industrial centrifugal pump.

## Dataset Overview
- Total samples: 259,200 (1-second resolution for 180 days)
- Features: 26 multi-modal sensor readings + Failure label
- Failure codes:  
  - 0: Normal  
  - 1: Bearing wear  
  - 2: Winding insulation degradation  
  - 3: Impeller damage/cavitation  
  - 4: Multi-fault condition
